# ðŸ—“ Meetings & Agenda

The terms of the [Operating Agreement](broken-reference) require that the DAO hold regular governance meetings.

Governance meetings will be held during the ["All In" weekly DAO meeting](https://lu.ma/79pv26co). The Governance CELL is responsible for raising all current governance topics for discussion at that time.&#x20;

### Meeting Agenda

A meeting agenda must be provided in advance of each meeting, including all known topics for discussion. A link to the agenda must be published in the [meeting announcement](meetings.md#announcements).

The Governance CELL is responsible for adding all current governance discussions to the meeting agenda at least 6 hours prior to the start of the meeting. DAO members may also submit discussion items directly to the agenda.

A summary of discussions held during the meeting should be included in the agenda document. All governance contributors should assist (collaboratively or in rotation) with the taking of notes during meetings.

Discussion topics not included in the meeting agenda will be considered of an advisory nature only.

### Meeting Announcements

Governance meetings must be announced in the DAO's official communication channels (such as Telegram), with a link to the meeting agenda. These announcements are typically made by the Community Experience CELL, however the Governance CELL will be responsible for announcing and/or facilitating the meeting if no other party is available to do so.
