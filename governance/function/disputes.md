### Ombuds

The DAO may elect or nominate Ombuds for the purpose of investigating and resolving disputes between members and the DAO, its CELLs or governance processes. Ombuds will act in an advisory capacity only.&#x20;

Governance contributors will make themselves available to ombuds and/or create a channel for ombudsperson communication, and are expected to work with ombuds (to a reasonable extent) to answer questions, receive feedback and resolve complaints.

DAO governance may decline the appointment of a specific ombudsperson for a reasonable, stated cause. If this occurs, a new ombudsperson should be selected.
