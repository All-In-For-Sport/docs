# üìÉ Proposal Stewardship

The Governance CELL provides assistance in the development and submission of new proposals to All In For Sport community governance.

### Proposal Development

The Governance CELL is available to assist members in authoring high-quality, compliant proposals to DAO governance. Members may request assistance via the [#‚ùì‚îÉgov-help](https://discord.com/invite/Y7v33jWPwW) channel in Discord.

Members requesting assistance with governance proposals will receive a pre-populated template based on the relevant [proposal standard](http://localhost:5000/s/NcqLg5yh5nHbK4GBvWYP/policies/proposals). At the members' request, the Governance CELL will assist in authoring the proposal body and submitting it to the [discussion form](../guides/community/discussion/forum.md).

If no proposal standard exists for the proposal, the issue is likely outside the scope of community governance. If the proposed new scope does not conflict with the operating agreement or agreed-upon domains of other governance bodies within the network, the governance CELL will assist the author(s) in creating a [state update proposal](http://localhost:5000/s/NcqLg5yh5nHbK4GBvWYP/policies/proposals/metagovernance) to expand the governance scope as needed.

### Sponsoring Proposals

Compliant proposals which are posted to the [discussion forum](../guides/community/discussion/forum.md) for the [minimum time period](http://localhost:5000/s/NcqLg5yh5nHbK4GBvWYP/policies/governance/voting#proposal-review-process) may be sponsored at the request of the author. The Governance CELL will assist the author in submitting the proposal to the designated Snapshot voting space. The Governance CELL will submit the proposal on their behalf at their request or if they do not hold the required governance badge.

**All compliant proposals will be sponsored**. The Governance CELL may not reject or impede proposals which comply with the DAO's [proposal standards](http://localhost:5000/s/NcqLg5yh5nHbK4GBvWYP/policies/proposals). If the Governance CELL determines that a proposal to poses a compliance risk or other existential threat to the DAO, this should be raised in the discussion forum. An issue may be raised within the DAO Advisory Group (if such a group exists) to block or delay a passing proposal which violates the terms of the [Operating Agreement](http://localhost:5000/s/NcqLg5yh5nHbK4GBvWYP/policies/membership/operating-agreement) or poses an immediate existential risk to the DAO and/or its members.
