# üîè Governance CELL State

## Purpose & Design

The purpose of the Governance team CELL is to work on developing and administering governance for the All in For Sport network. Its starting purpose and design can be found in the proposal to establish the CELL: [https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/work/GEN-14](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/work/GEN-14)

This Cell operates in collaboration with SuperBenefit and specifically the [DAO Primitive Project](https://app.clarity.so/superbenefit/docs/de8d2cdb-10da-4c55-90e2-c3afd0793827) which is working on a lot of the designs that are flowing into the AIFS governance design.

### Relationship to All In For Sport

Relationship to others in the network- This CELL is set up to design and implement the governance structure and tooling that AIFS needs to achieve its purpose.

* It is autonomous and makes its own decisions about what to do and how to manage itself
* It works in partnership with other CELL in a CELL of CELL structure - it does not yet hold a formal governance position on any CELL of CELLS.
* Its budget is approved by the CELL of CELL that immediately overseas the CELL
* Ultimately it serves the purpose of AIFS and responds to the direction that is set by AIFS Community Governance.
* As part of the AIFS network it commits to not do anything that would contravene the operating agreement and jeopardise the network's UNA status
* The Governance CELL will maintain this Cell-state as its way of providing transparency to the stakeholders including other CELLS and Community Governance

## Practice

### Participation

The Governance CELL is <mark style="color:green;">**OPEN**</mark> to new contributors.

To contribute to the Governance CELL, please introduce yourself in the [#governance-cell](https://discord.gg/jwmqjRBbRk) channel in Discord and express your desire to contribute. Be sure to describe your skills and experience, as well as the type of contribution you'd like to make.

Prospective contributors are expected to review all AIFS governance documentation and listen in on at least two tactical meetings before collaborating with the team.

### Decision-Making

This CELL runs at collaboration scale. To do this effectively we engage in low scale, high bandwidth team collaboration practices. This includes simple decision-making and collaboration protocols (such as liberating structures and consent based decision-making), we have flexibility to define these approaches ourselves but employ well used and regarded practices and tools.

We govern ourselves in a way that conforms with the AIFS operating agreement (TUNAA) does not jeopardize the wider network's UNA status - [https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/membership](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/membership)

#### Simple Decisions

Simple decisions are made informally within team meetings or on digital channels

#### Formal Decisions

Larger decisions, such as financial or token transactions and major updates to this governance state will be made by the team and entered into a decision log attached to this governance state document.

### Dispute Resolution

When conflict occurs that we can't resolve informally we will use more formal conflict management practices.

### Record-Keeping

We record decisions and activities transparently so that others in AIFS can understand what we do and how we do it. This allows for higher scale coordination across AIFS as well as ensuring that we as an operational function of AIFS take responsibility for our action in the wider community.

### Treasury

#### Multisig Contract

Currently the Cell does not yet have a multi-sig set up

#### Contributor Rewards

Currently there is no set up for rewarding contributors beyond a team decision that is logged formally in the decision log

#### Tokens & Badges

Currently the Cell doesn't have its own token

#### Bookkeeping

Financial transactions will be logged as archives in this governance state.

#### Decisions log

No decisions logged as yet
