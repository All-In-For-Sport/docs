# Creating a Proposal

All In for Sport members can create [proposals](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/proposals) to change the way the DAO governs itself. More proposal types (for new working groups (“CELLS”), treasury allocation and other purposes will be introduced in the future. The governance team is available to assist all members in creating and submitting their proposals to DAO governance.

Follow these instructions to create a new proposal. You should also review the [Proposal Standards](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/proposals) and [Voting Policy](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/governance/voting) before drafting your proposal.

Proposals should be [formatted](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/proposals#format) in a standardized manner. You can use the available [templates](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/proposals#templates) to quickly replicate the official proposal format in your editor of choice.

If you’re not ready to create a rough draft of your proposal, you can post your idea in the [General](https://commonwealth.im/all-in-for-sport/discussions/General) topic to discuss with your peers and gather feedback.

### Share Your Draft Proposal <a href="#step-1-share-your-draft-proposal" id="step-1-share-your-draft-proposal"></a>

[Create a thread](https://docs.commonwealth.im/commonwealth/for-community-members/creating-threads) in the [Governance topic](https://commonwealth.im/all-in-for-sport/discussions/Governance) containing the text of your proposal.

The title of your thread should match your proposal title, and should be short and descriptive (i.e., “Establish a Design Team”). It’s a good idea to add some background information (links to discussions, your motivation, rationale, etc.) above your proposal text to provide additional context.

The default proposal template will be pre-populated when you create your thread. You can compose your proposal using this template or you can delete the template and paste in your pre-written draft. This is only a rough draft and it’s okay if some parts are incomplete, but please make sure that the intent of your proposal is clear and easy to understand.

When you’re finished composing your thread, click the “Create Thread” button to post it to the governance topic.

#### Set the thread stage to “Upcoming Proposal” <a href="#1a-set-the-thread-stage-to-upcoming-proposal" id="1a-set-the-thread-stage-to-upcoming-proposal"></a>

We use “[Stages](https://docs.commonwealth.im/commonwealth/community-overview/threads/stages)“ to track the progress of proposals through the governance process. [Follow these instructions](https://docs.commonwealth.im/commonwealth/community-overview/threads/stages) to set your thread’s stage to “Upcoming Proposal”.

If you do not set a proposal stage, a moderator may comment and request more information to assist you in doing so.

### Temperature Check Poll (Optional) <a href="#1b-optional-temperature-check-poll" id="1b-optional-temperature-check-poll"></a>

You can create an informal, off-chain [poll](https://docs.commonwealth.im/commonwealth/for-community-members/polling) to gather community sentiment regarding your draft proposal. This can be a useful way to determine if major changes are needed before posting the first draft of your proposal for feedback.

[Follow these instructions](https://docs.commonwealth.im/commonwealth/for-community-members/polling) to create a poll inside your thread. You can also ask a member of the governance team to create a poll for you.

_Please note: There seems to be a bug in Commonwealth’s polling system which sets the default polling period to 12 days. Please manually set the polling period when creating a poll. We recommend a 5-day polling period._

### Submit Your First Draft for Feedback <a href="#step-2-submit-your-first-draft-for-feedback" id="step-2-submit-your-first-draft-for-feedback"></a>

When you have completed the first draft of your proposal, edit your thread to delete the text of your rough draft. Replace it with the full text of your first draft. Add a sequential proposal number to the beginning of the thread title, beginning with “AIFSIP-“ and ending in a colon (i.e., “AIFSIP-04: Establish a Design Team”). Then click the “Save” button to update your thread.

Leave a comment on your thread to indicate that you’ve updated the content of your draft proposal.

You can reach out to the governance team for assistance with this process.

#### Set thread stage to “Request for Feedback” <a href="#2a-set-thread-stage-to-request-for-feedback" id="2a-set-thread-stage-to-request-for-feedback"></a>

Similar to step **1a** above, [follow these instructions](https://docs.commonwealth.im/commonwealth/community-overview/threads/stages) to set your thread’s stage to “Request for Feedback”. This helps your peers identify the most relevant discussions.

_Your proposal must be posted for feedback for a **minimum of 3 days** before being submitted to Snapshot for vote. We recommend allowing a full week (7 days) for discussion prior to voting._

### Request Sponsorship for Your Proposal <a href="#step-3-request-sponsorship-for-your-proposal" id="step-3-request-sponsorship-for-your-proposal"></a>

After your proposal has reached the minimum feedback period, you may tag a member of the governance team to request that your proposal be submitted to Snapshot. A dedicated communication channel will be created for this purpose in the future.
