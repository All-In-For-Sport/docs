# Governance Proposals

Decisions are made collectively within [Community Governance](../) by submitting and voting on **proposals**. All proposals originate from [governance discussions](../discussion/) and are posted to the DAO's Snapshot voting space once the discussion has matured.

All DAO members are encouraged to participate in governance by reading and commenting in the [discussion forum](../discussion/forum.md), and by voting on submitted proposals in Snapshot.

## [Creating a Proposal](create.md)

Proposals are used to facilitate collective decision making and may be submitted by any member of the DAO.

Members may draft their own proposals according to the [proposal standards](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/proposals) and submit them for discussion to the [governance forum](../discussion/forum.md). Alternatively, members may request assistance from the governance team in crafting and submitting compliant proposals.

## [Voting on Proposals](broken-reference)

Members are able to vote on proposals submitted by other members or their self by signing a message with their Ethereum wallet on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/allinforsport.eth). The wallet used to sign the message must hold an All In For Sport [Membership NFT](https://state.allinforsport.org/policies/membership).

DAO members are encouraged to read and review all proposals and their related [discussions](../discussion/), which are linked for your convenience within the voting interface.
