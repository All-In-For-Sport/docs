# ðŸŒ± Community Governance

The All In For Sport treasury is governed by a broad community of contributors and stakeholders, called **Community Governance**, which protects AIFS by ensuring that the activities of the network are aligned with its stated purpose.

Members of community governance have **no financial stake** in the DAO treasury. They are able to participate in governance [discussions](./#governance-discussion), submit [proposals](./#governance-proposals) to the DAO, and vote on submitted proposals. Community governance serves several key purposes within the DAO:

* Changing the way All In For Sport governs itself.
* Making major changes to the network and its structure.
* Creating or updating rules for membership and participation.
* Setting new Milestones to move the network forward once major goals are achieved.

## [Governance Discussion](discussion/)

New governance issues are raised via [discussion](discussion/). Topics for governance discussion are hosted on our [governance forum](discussion/forum.md) and during [weekly meetings](../../function/meetings.md). All governance proposals must originate as discussions.

## [Governance Proposals](proposals/)

The DAO uses [proposals](proposals/) to make decisions related to active discussion topics. Members may [write and submit proposals](proposals/create.md) related to active [governance discussions](discussion/), or [request assistance](../../function/proposals.md) from the governance team.

## [DAO Advisory Group](broken-reference)

Community Governance is checked and balanced by its [advisors](broken-reference): A group of stakeholders, contributors, sponsors and beneficiaries from within the All In For Sport network.
