# Governance Meetings

All In For Sport governance meetings occur during our [weekly community calls](https://lu.ma/79pv26co). Governance meetings are intended to provide a forum for real-time communication regarding matters of DAO governance. All members are encouraged to attend.

### Synchronous Discussion

The progress and highlights of all current governance [discussion threads](forum.md) will be delivered during the governance meeting and opened for comment from the community. Relevant comments will be conveyed back into the discussion thread by the governance team.

If appropriate, a discussion added to the meeting agenda and addressed during the meeting will be  posted to the forum for ongoing discussion.&#x20;

### Meeting Agenda

To add an item to the meeting agenda, add it under the "Items for Discussion" heading of the current week's [meeting notes document](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/weekly). Items added to this section will be addressed and opened for discussion as time allows.

Topics discussed during the meeting which are \*not\* on the agenda will be considered of an advisory nature only.
