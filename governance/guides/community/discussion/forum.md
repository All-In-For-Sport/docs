#### Creating Polls

You can [add polls](https://docs.commonwealth.im/commonwealth/for-community-members/polling) to your discussion threads to gauge community sentiment regarding your proposal. If you do not add a poll to your discussion thread, one may be added for you by governance moderators.

We recommend that you set the polling time to **5 days** when creating your poll. This gives the community enough time to vote, access the results and discuss the outcome with others.&#x20;
