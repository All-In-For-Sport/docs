# Governance Discussion

Decisions made by Community Governance originate as formal **Governance Discussions**. This allows for members' voices to be raised and heard by the entire DAO when appropriate.&#x20;

Governance threads are posted on our [discussion forum](forum.md) for asynchronous discussion, and topics are raised during weekly [community & governance meetings](meetings.md) for real-time discussion. Members may submit topics to the forum or meeting agenda at any time.

## [Discussion Forum](forum.md)

Formal governance discussions are hosted on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/) at [discuss.allinforsport.org](https://commonwealth.im/all-in-for-sport/). Members are encouraged to read and follow the [Forum Guidelines](https://commonwealth.im/all-in-for-sport/discussion/10100-all-in-for-sport-community-forum-guidelines) and [Instructions](https://commonwealth.im/all-in-for-sport/discussion/10155-how-to-create-a-governance-proposal) before creating new threads.

You can also reach out to the governance team via the [#❓┃gov-help](https://discord.gg/Y7v33jWPwW) channel on discord for assistance or to have a discussion topic posted for you.

Forum topics are available for [general discussion](https://commonwealth.im/all-in-for-sport/discussions/General), [governance](https://commonwealth.im/all-in-for-sport/discussions/Governance) and [partnerships](https://commonwealth.im/all-in-for-sport/discussions/Partnerships).

## [Governance Meetings](meetings.md)

[Community & Governance Meetings](meetings.md) are held weekly to provide members an opportunity to raise topics for discussion amongst the DAO. All members are encouraged to attend.

All current [governance discussions](./) will be raised for comment during the meeting. Additional topics may be raised by adding them to the [meeting agenda](https://app.clarity.so/allinforsport/weekly). Discussion topics not included in the agenda prior to the meeting will be considered informal in nature.
